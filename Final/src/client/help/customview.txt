Client - Custom View: (IN DEVELOPMENT)

The Custom View allows the user to view previously recorded data.

The user is asked to specify a time period that includes a year, month, day, and time.

A graph is then displayed showing the historical data captured over this time period.

*Currently in development. A sample graph is shown to give a general idea of how the Custom View will function.
